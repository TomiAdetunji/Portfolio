<p>Hello! This is my portfolio of coding projects I have done in the pass.</p>

<p>I have been coding since the beginning of high school.
    Since then I have had the privilege of experience multiple coding
    languages such as HTML, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, and Linux.
    The languages I use the most and currently are Python and Java.
    I have many projects I have completed that I am very proud of 
    including this website!
